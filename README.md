# GAN_Projects
Generative Adversarial Networks are the future of AI primarily because they are different from your typical computer vision models.
What makes GANs unique is the fact that these computer vision model generate/create new data from previous data instead of just describing the data that it sees.

Most computer vision news articles that you hear of today are focused on descriptive modeling, meaning that these models were built to describe what it sees within a particular image or video sequence...GANS are much different.

You can think of GANS as AI that creates new content, giving machines the ability to create brand new content from previosu content that it was trained on. This type of AI is the most game changing and robust in our opinion at Vision Logic, but also the most scary (aside fro AGI).

GANS have the ability to create content that seems like a human being createded this content, but that's not the case. This kinf of new technology can scare (and does) scare the average consumer, primarily because it's giving computer the ability to generate "new ideas" that humans have not thought of.

In this repository, we have (and continue_ to create many GAN appllications that were for our own internal use cases our for some of our clients. 

Thanks for taking the time to looking at our repo and we look forward to creating more GAN applications in the near future.
